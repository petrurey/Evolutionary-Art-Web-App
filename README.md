# Evolutionary-Art-Web-App

My 3rd year Computer Science BSc final project: Evolutionary Art Web App. I am using this project to learn more about and consolidate knowledge regarding foundational web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also hoping to integrate a framework like React once I feel comfortable enough with all the other elements. This project heavily uses the [oCanvas library](http://ocanvas.org/) to simplify the programing of actions like "drag-and-drop" or creating shapes.

## File Descriptions

⭐ ### canvasPaint.js ⭐

When first starting the project I had no knowledge of the HTML canvas element and how I could translate my ideas regarding user interaction into code. I used [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqUM4mEYKA&ab_channel=DevEd) to implement
and play around with a paint functionality in canvas.

The user can click and drag their mouse to leave a "paint" trail.

⭐ ### flowerFractal.js ⭐

This script uses trigonomertry to create beautiful "flower" looking recursive shapes. I got inspired from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymmtEgp0Tuc&t=2s&ab_channel=Frankslaboratory) and converted the code to work with the oCanvas library.

⭐ ### fractalFunctionsTEST2.js ⭐

I used this for the initial implementation of "fractal algorithm" using the standard canvas tools. This recursive algorithm was the basis when I tried converting to the use of oCanvas.

⭐ ### fractalFunctionsTEST.js ⭐

I decided to create another fractal functions file to explore the possibility of various different outputs from functions as well as how those might work when translated using oCanvas.

⭐ ### fractalTree.html ⭐

Early implementation of a fractal tree that should be a .js file instead of a nested script inside a .html. I explored this further in the fractalFunction files.

⭐ ### mainArtPage.html ⭐

Main page where the web app is run.

⭐ ### mainPortfolioPage.html ⭐

Exploring having a main portfolio page that links to the web app. Work has not been pursued for this page and will eventually sit out of this specific project repository.

⭐ ### mouseInterationTEST.js ⭐

All development regarding the improvement of user interaction with the app. This means moving away from buttons and text boxes and allowing the user to use the mouse to spawn shapes.

⭐ ### ocanvasInteractionObjects.js ⭐

The file containing the definitions for all the parent shape objects, functions on how to spawn them and interaction with the main HTML page.

⭐ ### styleArtPage.css ⭐

Main art page styling.

⭐ ### stylePortfolioPage.css ⭐

Portfolio page styling.
