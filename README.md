# Evolutionary-Art-Web-App

My 3rd year Computer Science BSc final project: Evolutionary Art Web App. I am using this project to learn more about and consolidate knowledge regarding foundational web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also hoping to integrate a framework like React once I feel comfortable enough with all the other elements. This project heavily uses the [oCanvas library](http://ocanvas.org/) to simplify the programing of actions like "drag-and-drop" or creating shapes.

## File Descriptions

### ⭐ flowerFractal.js

This script uses trigonomertry to create beautiful "flower" looking recursive shapes. I got inspired from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymmtEgp0Tuc&t=2s&ab_channel=Frankslaboratory) and converted the code to work with the oCanvas library and further inputs.

### ⭐ fractalFunctions.js

Contains all the fractal functions. These are iterative functions that spawn one "fractal" shape.

### ⭐ fractalInteraction.js

Contains all the methods that are used to control the creation of fractals and handle all user interaction when it comes to drawing
fractals.

### ⭐ mainArtPage.html

Main page where the web app is run. Contains the canvas, button and input boxes.

### ⭐ mainPortfolioPage.html

Exploring having a main portfolio page that links to the web app. Work has not been pursued for this page and will eventually sit out of this specific project repository.

### ⭐ mouseInterationTEST.js

All development regarding the improvement of user interaction with the app. This means moving away from buttons and text boxes and allowing the user to use the mouse to spawn shapes.

### ⭐ ocanvasInteractionObjects.js

The file containing the definitions for all the parent shape objects, functions on how to spawn them and interaction with the main HTML page.

### ⭐ styleArtPage.css

Main art page styling.

### ⭐ stylePortfolioPage.css

Portfolio page styling.
